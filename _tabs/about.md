My name is Mircea, currently a Ph.D. student at the West University of TimiÈ™oara and a passionate person about Cybersecurity, Computers and Computer Science, Video Games and Music. 

This blog serves as both a professional and personal place to write down my thoughts and ideas. I intend to post anything related to my interests such as C.T.F. writeups, tutorial blog posts, a review here and there about games, movies, and books I especially enjoy and much more.

I really hope the content of this blog will be interesting or maybe useful to someone someday. As I write down my journey in the Cybersecurity domain and discover and admire things in some of my hobbies I see this blog as a great opportunity in immortalizing and exposing moments to the people on the World Wide Web. Moreover, it makes good practice for my writing and grammar too.

With that being said, thanks for visiting the blog.

> For now, the blog is empty. I am in the process of converting some CTF writeups I made into actual posts. Also in the meantime, I am trying to get used to hosting this blog with Github and working with Git Pages.
